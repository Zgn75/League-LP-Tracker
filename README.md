# League LP Tracker
A program that lets you track your LP through a GUI.

# 1.0 Devlogs
If you input any number above 100 in the gui the program will break. Will work on it on the next version.
The user can type in the textbox in the gui (i was too lazy to lock it) so will work on that as well.


If you have any questions, feel free to ask me through the [Issues](https://github.com/Zgn75/League-LP-Tracker/issues) page.
